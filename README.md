## Features

 * Chunk-based rendering.
 * 6 tools (Axe, Shovel, Hoe, Scythe, Milk Pail, Seed Bag).
 * Perlin noise based world generation.

## Upcoming/Planned

 * Energy statistic for the player that'd deplete when doing actions.
 * Crafting stations like the Campfire or the Kiln.
 * Dynamic chunk unloading and loading from memory.  
 * Dynamic chunk generation (the world is currently generated entire at once).
 * Stardew Valley style of farm buildings (pen, barn, coop, etc...).
 * Full-fledged villages with NPCs with whom you'd be able to trade and form relationships (maybe?).
